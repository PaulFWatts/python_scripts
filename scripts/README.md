# README for scripts directory
This directory contains production-ready, self-executing Python scripts for Windows 11 internals monitoring and other automation tasks.

- Place your main scripts here (e.g., monitor_windows_internals.py).
- Keep this directory for scripts intended to be run directly, not imported as modules.
